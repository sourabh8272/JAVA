 * As given there are two sample methods: First one returns the sum of
two numbers a and b and second one returns the subtraction of a and b. if
a-b is negative then return value would be 0. Use ternary operator to call
these two methods. If a>b then ternary should call sum(a,b) but if a<b
then ternary operator should call sub(a,b). Eventually print the result of
the ternary operation on variable a and b.
Note: Ternary operator can call a method even for true and false values
